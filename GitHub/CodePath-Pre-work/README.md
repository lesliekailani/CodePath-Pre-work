## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[While creating this submission I struggled a little figuring out how to add an image to the buttons. Throughout this project, I found the explanations given on how to add the codes to be very thorough and understandable. When deciding on what optional features to input into my code I found a lack of resources to do so. It took me some time googling and reading through multiple articles, on how to add the images, to find ones that aligned with the program I was using. I started out reading the articles, but thought it was going to take up too much time to complete the code with what I was able to learn in a short period of time. I then decided to look at the images and go from there. When completing the required task I was able to learn when to use HTML, css, and javascript. After about 30 minutes of trial and error, I was finally able to figure it out. From there I was very pleased with the work and time it took me to get it done. I found myself finding a flow of understanding and excitement about the project.  ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing my submission, one question that I have is what resources are used when developers get stuck. In this situation, I choose to google and read multiple articles to figure out the answer. Do developers choose this route or do they go to a specific place for any answer they may need? How long do web developers have to complete a project and how often are they given a new project? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would choose to add the optional feature of adding different audio clips to the buttons. I feel this would make my project stand out even more, due to the fact that it would be completely personalized. When reading the different options I choose to add photos to the buttons when they are being pressed down. I would also like to add matching audio clips with the photos to continue my theme of nature. Once I played the memory game a number of times, I found that I should’ve made the decision to speed up the clue playbacks.]
